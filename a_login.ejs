        </div>
        
        <h2>How Does Bioluminescence Work?</h2>
        <p>Bioluminescence occurs through a chemical reaction that produces light energy within an organism's body. This reaction involves a light-emitting molecule called luciferin and an enzyme called luciferase. When luciferin reacts with oxygen, it produces light.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Do Organisms Produce Light?</h2>
        <p>Organisms use bioluminescence for various purposes, including attracting mates, deterring predators, and luring prey. For example, the anglerfish uses a bioluminescent lure to attract unsuspecting prey in the dark depths of the ocean.</p>
        
        <h2>Where Can You See Bioluminescence?</h2>
        <p>Bioluminescence can be seen in various parts of the world, especially in marine environments. Some popular places to witness this natural light show include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Puerto Mosquito on Vieques Island, Puerto Rico</li>
            <li>Halong Bay, Vietnam</li>
            <li>Jervis Bay, Australia</li>
            <li>San Diego, California, USA</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Bioluminescence is a captivating natural phenomenon that illuminates the wonders of the ocean and other environments. It showcases the beauty and complexity of the natural world, leaving us in awe of the many ways life can adapt and thrive.</p>
